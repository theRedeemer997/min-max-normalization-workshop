# theRedeemer997-Lab5---Min-Max-Normalization-Manu-Nikitha-Parth

# Goal
The goal of the Lab5 is to normalize the dataset as the original dataset as the features can have values in the hundreds of thousands while other features have less values. This creates problems when we use algorithms that depend on numeric magnitudes.

# Dataset description
The dataset we use in this Lab is `housing_data.csv`. This dataset has numerous features like `Price`, `Lot_Size`, `Num_bedrooms`. We have picked couple of features like  `Price`, `Area_sqft`,` Num_Bedrooms`, `Num_Bathrooms`, `Lot_Size` to normalize.
