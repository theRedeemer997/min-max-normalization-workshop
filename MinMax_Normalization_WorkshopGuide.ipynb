        "## üß† Learning Objectives\n",
        "- Apply **Min-Max normalization** to real-world data during the EDA process.\n",
        "- Build **Jupyter Notebooks** with well-structured code and clear Markdown documentation.\n",
        "- Use **Git and GitHub** for collaborative version control and code sharing.\n",
        "- Identify and articulate coding issues (\"**talking points**\") and insert them directly into peer notebooks.\n",
        "- Practice **collaborative debugging**, professional peer feedback, and improve code quality.\n",

        "## üß© Workshop Structure (90 Minutes)\n",
        "1. **Instructor Use Case Introduction** *(5 min)* ‚Äì Set up teams of 3 people. Discuss real estate dataset and scaling rationale, plus submission instructions\n",
        "2. **Team Jupyter Notebook Development** *(25 min)* ‚Äì Manual Min-Max coding + Markdown documentation (work as teams)\n",
        "3. **Push to GitHub** *(5 min)* ‚Äì Teams commit and push initial notebooks. **Make sure to include your names so it is easy to identify the team that developed the Min-Max code**.\n",
        "4. **Peer Review Round** *(15 min)* ‚Äì Review the other team‚Äôs code and add a talking point (the most relevant one you can find). **Make sure to add your names so it is easy to identify the team that made the review**. You can follow the template included in **MinMax_Normalization_Workshop.ipynb**\n",
        "5. **Instructor Review** - The instructor will go around, take notes, and provide coaching as needed, during the **Peer Review Round**\n",
        "6. **Group Share-out** *(35 min)* ‚Äì Each team presents the talking point about the other team's Min-Max code.\n",
        "7. **Instructor Wrap-up** *(5 min)* ‚Äì Highlight good practices, reflect on peer feedback.\n",
